                        Imagine that you have an important speech that you need to present to an audience.<br />
                        Now, think what would happen if you did not practice in front of the mirror, but in front<br />
                        of the phone. As part of the final project at Sapir College, I was asked to characterize <br />
                        and design an application that will give the user a platform to practice his speech, <br />
                        and at the end will provide qualitative and quantitative feedback that will improve <br />
                        the funding of standing in front of a stage and presentation.
